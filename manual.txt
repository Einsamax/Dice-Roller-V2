This is an updated dice roller that allows you to roll any number of D2, D3, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, and D100 dice that you wish. 
This version is improved as there is less code, making use of functions and splicing. I also used two while loops to ensure proper inputs are selected.

With love,
